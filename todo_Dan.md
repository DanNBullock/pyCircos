- figure out how to default add a cleft to the top center, use this area to have figure legend?
- figure out elegant way to handle tic marks  (maybe interior)
- figure out way to scale figure elements (i.e. fonts, line thickness, tick mark sizes) with figure size.
- come up with better way to pass specific seaborn calls to axes and such
- implement a non warped -but still arc windowed- plotting mechanism (e.g. for "world" images, anatomy etc)
- implement outer labels / color swatches
- implement interior chord plot
- implement mechanism for variable
