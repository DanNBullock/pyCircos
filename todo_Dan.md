- figure out how to default add a cleft to the top center, use this area to have figure legend?
- figure out elegant way to handle tic marks  (maybe interior)
- figure out way to scale figure elements (i.e. fonts, line thickness, tick mark sizes) with figure size.

- implement a non warped -but still arc windowed- plotting mechanism (e.g. for "world" images, anatomy etc)
- implement outer labels / color swatches
- implement interior chord plot

- sort this list by difficulty

- 0. sort this list by difficulty
- 1. implement outer labels / color swatches
- 2. figure out elegant way to handle tic marks  (maybe interior)
- 3. figure out how to default add a cleft to the top center, use this area to have figure legend?



Done?
- come up with better way to pass specific seaborn calls to axes and such (mostly, but some plots are going to be a pain, i.e. count/frequency based plots)
- implement mechanism for variable circumferential divisions (de facto behavior, but we need a way to non-hardcode this)
